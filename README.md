# Global Open Collaborated Curriculum

The objective of this repository is to design a curriculum for all classes and countries.

I know it is hard but possible. It is only possible if people from across the globe collaborate.

As of now, the countries' governments impose the curriculum. Such a curriculum has biases and vested interested of the governments.
These days people move between countries and the rapid development in science is happening globally, it is imperative to have a global curriculum in which the people from across the world are contributing.
This should be like Wikipedia.


I was soon be announcing the meetups and groups for the discussions.
